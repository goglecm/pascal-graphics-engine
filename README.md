# Description

This project is an attempt at creating a 3D world and rotating a cube in it. It
uses a 3D array with each entry in it representing a pixel. As the cube rotates,
it starts distorting due to the truncation from the integer calculations (no
floating point calculations are performed).

# Build/run

This was originally developed in Borland's Turbo Pascal IDE, running on
Windows XP.

This needs to be ported to compile and run on Linux and not use Windows specific
units.

# Other points

The language is a bit mixed up in the source, so it needs to be normalised to
English.
