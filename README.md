# Description

This project is an attempt at creating a 3D world and rotating a cube in it.

It uses a 3D array with each entry in it representing a pixel. As the cube
rotates, it starts to distort due to the truncation from the integer
calculations (no floating point calculations are performed).

# Build/run

This was originally developed in Borland's Turbo Pascal IDE, running on
Windows XP.

Currently it only runs using Free Pascal on Windows.

This needs to be ported to compile and run on Linux and not use Windows specific
units.

When ran, use the arrow keys to rotate the cube.

I've got a better version of this, without distortion and much better
programming.

# Other points

The language is a bit mixed up in the source, so it needs to be normalised to
English.
